The Python file titled testing_sparse_matrix.py was an attempt to convert the Yahoo music data sets into a sparse matrix, in which each user was a row and each item of any type (track ID, Album, Artist, genre(s)) is a column. By converting the data into a sparse matrix in a Pandas Dataframe, we would have much more ability to apply other techniques for making recommendations such as clustering. For example, we could vectorize each user row, then make recommendations based on a track's vector proximity using Euclidean distance between two points. You can use the cosine of the angle to find the similarity between a user's preferences and a track.
