The Python file titled testing_sparse_matrix.py was an attempt to convert the Yahoo music data sets into a sparse matrix, in which each user was a row and each item of any type (track ID, Album, Artist, genre(s)) is a column. By converting the data into a sparse matrix in a Pandas Dataframe, we would have much more ability to apply other techniques for making recommendations such as clustering. For example, we could vectorize each user row, then make recommendations based on a track's vector proximity using Euclidean distance between two points. You can use the cosine of the angle to find the similarity between a user's preferences and a track.

This attempt ultimately didn't work as planned because my local PC and Google Colab notebook could not support the large matrix in RAM. Even an attempt to do a batched approach in which after each batch processed, the memory is freed up, the computations were too intensive. We have not ruled out this effort quite yet, but as of now it looks like to be too resource intensive to execute.
